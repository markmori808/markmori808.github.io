<h1>WHY?</h1>
    <p>I am taking APCSP becuase I recognize the increasing presence computers and technology has in the world. As it is now I have little to no knowledge regarding computer software. So being able to code and work with the technology is an important skill I would like to have. I have no doubt that the ability to code will prove to be useful in the years to come.</p>
    <p>Upon completing this class I hope to have a basic understanding of how to code in several different languages. With that knowledge I hope to further expand on it through coding projects of my own. Because of the widespread use of technology and computer software, the things learned in APCSP will inevitably benefit me in my daily life. </p>
